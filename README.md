# Introduction to D3.js

This repository contains the Presentation materials and supporting code for Introduction to D3.js

## Setup
Make sure to have d3.js and d3.min.js copied into this level of the file system.

Use the `start-web-server.bat` file to start up a local web server on port 8000.  On a Windows system you can simply double click on the batch file.

On a \*NIX system kick it off like a shell script:
`. start-web-server.bat`

Open your browser to `localhost:8000`

When you are done, you can stop the running webserver with a `<ctrl><c>`.
